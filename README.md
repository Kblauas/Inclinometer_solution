# Inclinometer_solution
codes for prototyping the inclinometer
Currently we are at the end (hopefully) of the prototyping stage: the main code works for the most part, but the data is not being imprinted, or sent, to the python plots.
this can either be a problem related to the rs485, or to the python GUI.
[Update 27/05/2025]
The code now works well. All parts of it are working as expected, meaning that the data aquisition from the sensors, data calibration -using different methods for the adxl355 accelerometer and the mpu6050 gyroscope-, data filtering using a complementary filter, a second-order low-pass butterworth filter, and a moving average filter that goes through 100 iterations before showing the final values, which are then sent through a buffer by the rs485 user-built library. As of today, all of this, including the python GUI is working. However. there is still one problem that we ought to get through: the mpu6050 has shown I2c communication erros throughout the project, and, as of today, this has no solution. This problem is most likely due to one of three possibilities: a project error, a building error, or a component error. Through software, there is no way to currently get through this error, so as of today, even though the code itself works, there is no way to actually use the gyroscope measurements reliably.
