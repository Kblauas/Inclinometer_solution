# Inclinometer_solution
codes for prototyping the inclinometer
Currently we are at the end (hopefully) of the prototyping stage: the main code works for the most part, but the data is not being imprinted, or sent, to the python plots.
this can either be a problem related to the rs485, or to the python GUI.
